The _MACPro Design System_ contains shared design and front-end development resources for MACPro applications, and is built on top of the [CMS Design System](https://design.cms.gov/) (CMSDS). As a _child design system_, it inherits base styles, components, and guidance from the CMS Design System, while also adding its own features and customizations.

## Usage

`npm install @mpds/ds-macpro-gov`

For full documentation on installation and usage in your MACPro product, please refer to [our documentation site](https://cmsgov.github.io/design-system/startup/installation/).

## Contributing

This is a design system established for MACPro developers and designers to consume. It contains very similar styling to core CMSDS with added components such as multi-select dropdown.

## Development

See the [root CMSDS README](../../README.md).

## Design assets

One bigger difference to MACPro's Design System is the usage of Figma as a source of design truth. [You can find that here](https://test)
